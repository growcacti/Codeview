# Codeview
Project to make coding tools while learning to write code
Coming up with tools to make code quick code view and other tools I think will help understand other aspects on creating software.
Creating my own coding tool should help me learn faster as it applies to overall language and feature that may normally be obvious.
Alot of this code should run but are not enitirly complete. One might understand where I am going with this feel free to help or use this code if it helps you
